## üöÄ Introduction

We propose an adaptive fast-slow thinking framework for high-quality dialogue data synthesis: **SOTOPIA-Œ©**. This framework addresses the **negotiation deadlock** issue in social conversations.

Despite the abundance of prior social strategies possessed by humans, there remains a paucity of research dedicated to their transfer and integration into social agents. Our proposed SOTOPIA-Œ© framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects a variety of social strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that are complementary to social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpasses the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhances S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent's prolonged deadlock.
